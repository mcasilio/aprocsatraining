# Hello and welcome to the aprocsa training repository!
last updated: 11/13/2024

This is a repository of materials supporting a submitted manuscript, 'A clinical training program for auditory-perceptual rating of connected speech in aphasia.' This repository is currently archived as a means of sharing the files with the public in a read-only format. However, it is still actively maintained. Any questions concerning the analyses or code can be sent to: marianne.e.casilio@vanderbilt.edu. 

To use materials in this repository, we ask that future authors cite the following:

Casilio, M, Dutta, M, Bryan, K, Crouch, K, Dewall, Z, Feld, I, Kile, J, McMahan, K, Samora, J, Shibata, K, Steel, S, Kasdan, AV, Walljasper, L, de Riesthal, M, & Wilson, SM. (submitted). A clinical training program for auditory-perceptual rating of connected speech in aphasia. 

# Analyses
The zip folder **analyses.zip** contains three data files and one code file for replicating analyses reported in the manuscript:

**aprocsatraining_pretrain.txt**

**aprocsatraining_posttrain.txt**

These two files contain ratings across all 27 APROCSA features and all 6 discourse samples, both pre- and post-training, for the 8 SLP members of the working group.

**icc_correl.txt**

This file contains data necessary for completing the exploratory correlations reported in the manuscript, including (1) change scores in ICCs pre- and post-training for the 8 SLPs, (2) years of clinical experience for the 8 SLPs, and (3) self-report of pre-training confidence in discourse analysis for the 8 SLPs. Data from (2) and (3) are also reported in the pretraining survey file detailed below; however, for completing the analyses, the text categories (e.g., "fairly confident") were converted to a numerical five-point scale where higher scores indicate greater confidence.

**aprocsatraining.R**

This file contains the code for completing the analyses reported in the manuscript.

# Surveys
The zip folder **surveys.zip** contains three data files of survey responses from the 8 SLP members of the working group.

**aprocsatraining_pretrain.csv**

**aprocsatraining_posttrain.csv**

**aprocsatraining_oneyearsurvey.csv**

Of note: In the pretraining survey, responses in columns starting with "Training content" and "Training activities" reflect relative rankings among all possible items in that category, with lower scores indicating higher priority.
